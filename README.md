Welcome to my learning repository for the **[Chai aur React](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAV69dS1uWTyP_vM3Q5JLFQ1bY1a_k6F)** series by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/@HiteshChoudhary).

This repo documents my hands-on journey into the world of **React.js**, where I’m building, breaking, and understanding everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts — one cup of chai at a time ☕💻.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand React fundamentals — components, JSX, props, and state.
- Master hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks.
- Learn to structure React projects the *right* way.
- Explore **Context API**, **React Router**, and **custom hooks**.
- Build real-world projects (from beginner to advanced).
- Strengthen JavaScript concepts while integrating them into React.
